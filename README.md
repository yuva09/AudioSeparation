The audio separation project using Fourier transform method involves using advanced signal processing techniques to separate individual audio sources from a complex mixture of sounds.

 The project will use the Fourier transform to convert the audio signals from the time domain to the frequency domain, where each frequency component of the audio signal can be analyzed and manipulated separately. 

The project will require a deep understanding of the Fourier transform and its applications in audio signal processing. The implementation will involve using software tools such as MATLAB or Python to perform the necessary mathematical operations on the audio signals.

 The project will also require a thorough understanding of digital signal processing techniques such as filtering, windowing, and spectral analysis. The goal of the project is to develop an effective and efficient algorithm that can separate multiple audio sources from a mixed audio signal with high accuracy.

 The project will involve a rigorous testing and evaluation process to ensure that the algorithm performs well under different scenarios and with different types of audio signals.

 The final deliverable will be a software tool that can perform audio separation using the Fourier transform method, which can be used in a variety of applications such as music production, speech recognition, and audio restoration.
